Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   163 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 163
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        169 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      167 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              99
      Number using O5 output only:              18
      Number using O5 and O6:                   50
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        20
    Number using O6 output only:                20

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    82 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          246
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            83 out of     246   33%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  77 out of     246   31%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          86 out of     246   34%
    Number of unique control sets:              11
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        36 out of     480    7%

    Number using BlockRAM only:                  1
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               1
    Total Memory used (KB):                     36 out of   2,160    1%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
